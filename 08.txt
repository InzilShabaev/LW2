Sometimes I
need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I
need you to STAY AWAY FROM ME
Sometimes I'm
in disbelief i didn't know
Somehow I
need you to go

Don't Stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't Stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't Stay

Sometimes I
feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I
just feel like SCREAMING AT MYSELF
Sometimes I'm
in disbelief I didn't know
Somehow I
need to be alone

Don't Stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't Stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't Stay

I dont need you
anymore
I dont want to be ignored
I dont need one
more day
of you wasting me away
I dont need you
anymore
I dont want to be ignored
I dont need one
more day
of you wasting me away...
(With no apologies)

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't Stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
