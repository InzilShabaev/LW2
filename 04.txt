Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I`m picking me apart again
I`m safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don`t want to be the one
The battles always choose
`Cause inside I realize
That I`m the one confused

I don`t know what`s worth fighting for
And Show You What I Mean
I don`t know why I insitigate
And say what I don`t mean
I don`t know how I got this way
I know it`s not alright
So I`m breaking the habit
Tonight

I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don`t want to be the one
The battles always choose
`Cause inside I realize
That I`m the one confused

I don`t know what`s worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don`t know why I insitigate
And say what I don`t mean
I don`t know how I got this way
I`ll never be alright
So I`m breaking the habit
Tonight

I`ll paint it on the walls
`Cause I`m the one at fault
I`ll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don`t know what`s worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don`t know why I insitigate
To show you what I mean
I don`t know how I got this way
I`ll never be alright
So,I`m breaking the habit
I`m breaking the habit
I`m breaking the habit
Tonight
