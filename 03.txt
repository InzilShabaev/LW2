Yeah here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line

Flow em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Fithy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose

String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so i won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Run myself out and no one cares

Dug the trench out lay it down there
With the shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again

Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out


Go start the show
Drop your boys and the sloppy flow

Shotgun I put lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Mama help me I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse

Candy paint on this brand new hearse
Can't contain him he knows he works

Practice hurts I wont lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try

Half the words dont mean a thing
And I know that I wont be satisfied

So why try ignoring it
Make it a dirt dance floor again

Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in


I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out

I've opened up these skies
I'll make you face this

I bought myself some fire
I'll make you, face, this, now!!!!


I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away

Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
