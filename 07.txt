Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is realThere's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
ControllingI can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecureChorusDiscomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem...To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecureChorus (Repeat until end)There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
